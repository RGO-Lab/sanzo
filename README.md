> Sanzo Wada (1883-1967) was an artist, teacher, costume and kimono designer during a turbulent time in avant-garde Japanese art and cinema. Wada was ahead of his time in developing traditional and Western influenced colour combinations, helping to lay the foundations for contemporary color research. Based on his original 6-volume work from the 1930s, this book offers 348 color combinations with CMYK and Pantone numbers, as attractive and sensuous as the book’s own design. – *A Dictionary Of Color Combinations*
