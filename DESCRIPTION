Description: Inspired by the art and color research of Sanzo Wada, his 
    Dictionary Of Color Combinations, and the incredible interactive site
    by Dain M. Blodorn Kim, this package brings Wada's color combinations
    to R for easy use in data visualizations. This package honors 60 of 
    Wada's color combinations: 20 duos, 20 trios, and 20 quads.
