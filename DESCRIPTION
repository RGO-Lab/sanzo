Description: Inspired by the art and color research of Sanzo Wada (1883-1967), 
    his Dictionary Of Color Combinations (2011, ISBN:978-4861522475), and the 
    interactive site by Dain M. Blodorn Kim <https://github.com/dblodorn/sanzo-wada>, 
    this package brings Wada's color combinations to R for easy use in data 
    visualizations. This package honors 60 of Wada's color combinations: 
    20 duos, 20 trios, and 20 quads.
